This project is for practicing converting alreay converted HTML/CSS project into react based application.
In this project, I made the entire html and css based code to be simpler by
 converting them into components and making use of react libaray.

While deploying because of warning, if the build is not deployed.

In package.json, add this in scripts

"build": "CI= react-scripts build",
"local-build": "react-scripts build",
